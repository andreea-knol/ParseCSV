# Parse CSV

This program parses a CSV file. It reads the data line by line and saves the information in an array of hashes. Then it displays all the rows that contain the text '205/70 R 15'. It extracts only the digits from the column called 'IPC Manufacturier' and saves them into another column called 'IPC Manufacturier clean'. Then it creates another CSV file containing all the columns plus the new one called 'IPC Manufacturier clean'.
